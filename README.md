# Time & Tasks 2

Turn your python projects into a task master and scheduling genie with the magic of Celery &amp; Redis.

In this project, we're going to learn all about the popular python library [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html) to help our projects offload tasks, especially time-intensive tasks, to a worker process. We'll also implement scheduling inside of Celery as well.



### Tech Stack
- Python 3.6+
- Django 3+ (possibly even Django 1.11+)
- Celery 4+
- Redis 6+


## The Book.
For time & tasks, I'll be writing a corresponding book. In the past, I would write private notes to help me with the recording process. For this series, I have decided to publish these notes as a "work-in-progress" book right here on github. Depending on how everyone likes the book portion, I'll consider fully publishing the book into more consumable formats. Do you like the book? Let me know -> [@joincfe](https://twitter.com/joincfe).

## The Videos.
The videos will loosely follow the content in the book. The major difference will be the context that's discussed while building the project. Personally, I think the book will only scratch the surface of what's in the videos.
